## General guidance for contributing to Kusk Gateway project

You're very welcome to help in Kusk Gateway development, there is a lot of incoming work to do :). 

We're trying hard to limit technical debt from the beginning so we defined simple rules into Kusk Gateway repo to help with it.

### For golang based components

- Always use gofmt (there is only one true way of doing code formatting ;) ).
- Follow golang good practices (proverbs) in your code.
- Tests are your friend (we will target 80% CC in our code).
- Use clean names, don't break basic design patterns and rules.

### For infrastructure / Kubernetes based components

- We're using helm charts to build and share Kusk Gateway
- Comment non-obvious decisions
- Use current Helm/Kubernetes versions
