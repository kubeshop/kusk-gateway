# Welcome to Kusk Gateway

Kusk Gateway enables you to design and configure your APIs from single OpenAPI manifest and you can:

- ‚ö° **Rapidly prototype your APIs** by mocking your API responses, allowing your teams to instantly start building on top of your APIs without your services being implemented
- üîí Protect your endpoints with **automatic request and response validations**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configure critical policies like request timeouts and CORS with **no coding required**
- üßê Centrally control your APIs from an Open Source dashboard

## Get Started

Check out our [Getting Started section](https://kubeshop.github.io/kusk-gateway/getting-started) to install Kusk Gateway, deploy an example API and connect a service to the API.
