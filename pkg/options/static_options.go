	Domain search order:
	1. Exact domain names: www.foo.com.
	2. Suffix domain wildcards: *.foo.com or *-bar.foo.com.
	3. Prefix domain wildcards: foo.* or foo-*.
	4. Special wildcard * matching any domain. (edited)

	// different methods in one YAML document.
	// E.g. if GET / goes to frontend, and POST / goes to API, you cannot specify path as a key with the different methods twice in one YAML file.
