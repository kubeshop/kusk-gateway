                  has specific toleration labels, optional
                items:
                  description: The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any
                    taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching
                    operator <operator>.
                  properties:
                    effect:
                      description: Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty
                        means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values
                        are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
                      type: string
                    key:
                      description: Key is the taint key that the toleration applies
                        to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty,
                        operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all
                        values and all keys.
                      type: string
                    operator:
                      description: Operator represents a key's relationship to the
                        value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod
                        can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                      type: string
                    tolerationSeconds:
                      description: TolerationSeconds represents the period of time
                        the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise
                        this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it
                        is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not
                        evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
                        immediately) by the system.

                      description: Value is the taint value the toleration matches
                        to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty,
                        otherwise just a regular string.
