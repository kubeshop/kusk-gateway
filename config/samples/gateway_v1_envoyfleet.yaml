  # Scheduling directives
  # Read https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/ for the details.

  # Optional - schedule Envoy pods to the node with the label "disktype=ssd".
  # nodeSelector:
  #   disktype: "ssd"

  # Optional - allow to be scheduled on the "tainted" node. Taint with "kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule".
  # Taints will repel the pods from the node unless the pods have the specific toleration.
  # The line below will allow this specific Envoy pod to be scheduled there (but scheduler decideds where to put it anyway).
  # tolerations:
  # - key: "key1"
  #   operator: "Exists"
  #   effect: "NoSchedule"

  # Optional - provide pods affinity and anti-affinity settings.
  # This is more flexible than nodeSelector scheme but they can be specified together.
  # For the scalability and fault tolerance we prefer to put all Envoy pods onto different nodes - in a case one node fails we survive on others.
  # The block below will search for all matching labels of THIS "default" envoy fleet pods and will try to schedule pods
  # on different nodes.
  # Other fleets (if present) are not taken into consideration. You can specify nodeAffinity and podAffinity as well.
