# Privacy Policy

With the aim to improve the user experience, Kusk collects anonymous usage data.

You may [opt-out](#how-to-opt-out) if you'd prefer not to share any information.

The data collected is always anonymous, not traceable to the source, and only used in aggregate form. 

Telemetry collects and scrambles information about the host when the API server is bootstrapped for the first time.
