# When Can You Use Kusk?

Kusk fits with both new and existing APIs:

## Existing Projects

If your current project already uses OpenAPI or you want to start using it, Kusk fits well in both scenarios and can replace your existing Kubernetes Ingress Controller. Kusk will provide your current APIs with great documentation portal for the consumers of your APIs, request validation for instant protection and response mocking out of the box instantly.

Kusk is ready to handle any request size as it uses Envoy under-the-hood to handle the traffic of your APIs.

## New Projects

If you are just starting a new API project in Kubernetes, Kusk lets you mock your APIs so you can start developing your APIs without implementing the services. Kusk also provides your API with out-of-the-box security features like rate-limiting, authentication, CORS, and more.
