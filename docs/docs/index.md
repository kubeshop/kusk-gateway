# Kusk Gateway

Kusk Gateway is a self-service API gateway powered by [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) and [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)!

Kusk Gateway enables you to design and configure your APIs from single OpenAPI manifest and you can:

- ‚ö° **Rapidly prototype your APIs** by mocking your API responses
- ü•∑üèΩ Protect your endpoints with **automatic request and response validations**
- üî• Configure critical policies like request timeouts and CORs with **no coding required**
- üßê Centrally control your APIs from an Open Source dashboard


Kusk Gateway is for you if:

- You or your team develop REST APIs running in Kubernetes.
- You embrace a contract-first approach to developing your APIs using OpenAPI or Swagger.
- You want to ramp-up time when deploying a new REST api to a cluster and you don't want to spend lots of time configuring ingress controllers that require a dedicated Ops Engineer.
- You want your REST API endpoints traffic to be observable and controllable with the easy to use settings.
