# Kusk docs

You can find the docs here: kusk.io/docs

## Edit the docs

If you're editing the docs, follow this workflow:

1- Update the docs inside the `/docs` folder (they're good 'ol markdown)
2- (if there's a new page in the docs) add it to the file `sidebar.js` so the menu on the left is updated
