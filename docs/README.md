# Kusk docs

You can find the docs here: docs.kusk.io

## Edit the docs

If you're editing the docs, follow this workflow:

1. Spin up local development with `npm run start`

2. Update the docs inside the `/docs` folder (they're good 'ol markdown)

3. if there's a new page in the docs, add it to the file `sidebar.js` so the menu on the left is updated
